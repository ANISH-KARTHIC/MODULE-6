# ðŸ§© Module 6: Organizing the Guessing Game Using Functions

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Module Matters  
- Introduces modular programming by breaking code into reusable blocks  
- Helps improve code readability and maintainability  
- Encourages thinking about problem-solving in smaller, manageable pieces  
- Lays the groundwork for more complex programming concepts

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in This Module  
- Teaches how to define and call functions in Python using the `def` keyword  
- Shows how to pass inputs (parameters) and return outputs from functions  
- Enables structuring the guessing game into separate logical parts (e.g., getting input, checking guess)

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Introduced  
- **Functions**: Named blocks of code designed to perform a specific task  
- **Parameters and Arguments**: Passing data into functions for processing  
- **Return Values**: Sending results back from functions to be used elsewhere  
- **Code Reusability**: Avoiding repetition by calling functions multiple times
